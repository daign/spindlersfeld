## Painting the walls

The walls are painted with the `Brillux Ecofinish 947` paint. Unfortunately the smallest available package is 15 liters. If you need to get your apartment painted or apply some small fixes, it is suggested to ask in the WhatsApp group first, maybe you can team up with other people and save costs.
