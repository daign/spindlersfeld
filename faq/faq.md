# Frequently asked/answered questions

## The fan in the bathroom is always on, is this normal?

Yes, this is completely normal. The air vent has a humidity sensor and it will adjust the RPM of the fan accordingly, but it will never come to a complete stop. 

## I have to paint the wall, what should I do?

The walls are painted with the `Brillux Ecofinish 947` paint. Unfortunately the smallest available package is 15 liters. If you need to get your apartment painted or apply some small fixes, it is suggested to ask in the WhatsApp group first, maybe you can team up with other people and save costs.
